 - `npm run build` : Builds the elm source to public/built/index.js
 - `npm run watch` : Watches elm files in src for changes, and runs `npm run build` when changes are detected
 - `npm run serve` : Starts up a server in the public directory, and live-reloads when public/built/*.js or public/*.css change
 - `npm start` : Runs `serve` and `watch` concurrently for you

Bootstrap CSS (but not JS) is included.
